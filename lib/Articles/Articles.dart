      'Echo Chambers, Fake News, and Social Epistemology',
      'Jennifer Lackey',
      "A familiar criticism of Donald Trump is that, in watching only Fox News and similar news sources, he is creating a dangerous echo chamber for himself. Echo chambers are said to be responsible for a host of today’s problems, including the degradation of democracy. This diagnosis is fundamentally incorrect, and this chapter examines the two dominant explanations of the distinctively epistemic problem with echo chambers and shows that each is wanting. Echo chambers, by themselves, are not epistemically problematic. Echo chambers are characterized in purely structural terms, but what is needed to capture what is wrong with Trump’s exposure to only Fox News is content-sensitive. It is not that Trump is relying on a single source for news, but that he is relying on one that is unreliable. Finally, the chapter calls attention to the challenge of social media bots and the role of non-ideal social epistemologyKeywords:   echo chamber, fake news, lack of independence, lack of awareness, diversity, bots, social epistemologyIt’s no secret that Donald Trump is a fan of Fox News. Indeed, reports1 claim that he recently raged at staff members when his wife, Melania, was caught watching “fake news” CNN aboard Air Force One. Apparently, the matter was resolved when Trump’s staff confirmed that, moving forward, it would be standard operating procedure to have all TVs tuned to Fox.Word of this elicited what is now a familiar criticism of Trump—that he is carefully curating his own consumption of news so that it includes information only from likeminded supporters. In so doing, he is said to be illegitimately reinforcing his own beliefs and sheltering himself from criticism. He is, in other words, creating a dangerous echo chamber for himself. The problem with echo chambers is vividly captured by a well-known example from Wittgenstein in which he describes someone assuring himself of the truth of a report by reading several different copies of the same newspaper. Whether you read one or one thousand copies of today’s New York Times, the evidence you take in about today’s news is exactly the same. You can’t increase the epistemic status of your views by simply consulting multiple versions of the same source.Echo chambers of this sort are said to be responsible for a host of today’s problems, including the degradation of democracy. By insulating ourselves from opposing views and disagreement, we are stunting our ability to engage in effective deliberation about the most pressing issues of our time. As Cass Sunstein says in his book, #Republic: Divided Democracy in the Age of Social Media, “In a well-functioning democracy, people do not live in echo chambers or information cocoons” (Sunstein 2017, p. ix.).In this chapter, I argue that this diagnosis of what is wrong with the sort of consumption of news exemplified by Trump is fundamentally incorrect. In particular, I examine the two dominant explanations of the distinctively epistemic problem with echo chambers and show that each is wanting. Echo chambers, by themselves, are not epistemically problematic. I then highlight how echo (p.207) chambers are characterized in purely structural terms, but what is needed to capture what is wrong with Trump’s exposure to only Fox News is content-sensitive. In other words, it is not that Trump is relying on a single source for news, but that he is relying on one that is unreliable. This makes the problem of discriminating between fake and real news more pressing than ever. I then show that the prevalence of social media bots poses an additional set of epistemological problems for online activity, ones that non-ideal social epistemology should be well-positioned to address.",

      'The Practical Origins of IdeasGenealogy as Conceptual Reverse-Engineering',
      'Matthieu Queloz',
      "This introductory chapter presents the questions and concerns animating the book and outlines its two main theses: that there is an under-appreciated tradition of pragmatic genealogy which cuts across the analytic–continental divide, and that these genealogies are dynamic models serving to reverse-engineer the points of ideas in relation to generic and local needs. After sharpening key notions such as ‘genealogy’, ‘living by an idea’, and ‘conceptual practice’, the pragmatic genealogical tradition that forms the topic of the book is brought into view and contrasted with other genealogical traditions. It is shown how this particular method proves puzzling in various ways and resists assimilation to better-known methods. This motivates the search for an attractive systematic account of the method that can make sense of its more puzzling features. The last section of the chapter then offers a rationale for developing this systematic account by doing history of philosophy.Keywords:   genealogy, state of nature, historiography, models, reconstruction, money, history of philosophy, analytic–continental divide, systematic–historical divideWe did not make the ideas we live by. They are, for the most part, ideas we inherited, unthinkingly growing into patterns of thought cultivated by others, with little sense of why just these ways of seeing, valuing, and reasoning should have gained hold in the first place. Some ideas, like that of water, may be so plainly useful for creatures like us as to appear inevitable. But many of our most venerable ideas—such as truth, knowledge, or justice—are highly abstract, and their practical value for us is elusive. Why did these ‘highest concepts’, these ‘last wisps of smoke at the evaporating end of reality’ (TI, Reason, §4), as Nietzsche called them, ever become so important to us? What was the point of coming to think in terms of these grand abstractions, and what would we lose if we lacked them?Such Pragmatic Questions about the practical origins of ideas have seldom been raised. They have tended to be side-lined by more traditional Socratic Questions of the form ‘What is X?’ Aiming straight at the essence of truth, knowledge, or justice, the Socratic approach reckons that if only we achieve clarity about what these things really are, an understanding of why we came to be concerned with them will follow. Socratic Questions can prove obstinately vexing, however, and a consensus on what truth, knowledge, or justice are has yet to emerge. Accordingly, some have concluded with the American pragmatist C. S. Peirce that ‘we must not begin by talking of pure ideas—vagabond thoughts that tramp the public highways without any human habitation—but must begin with men and their conversation’ (1931, 8.112). Peirce, like the philosophers I discuss in this book, diagnosed a tendency in philosophy to set ideas too high above human affairs, to contemplate them entirely in vacuo. Ideas are in their element in distinctive contexts of purposive human action, action that takes place against a background of contingent facts about us and the world we live in. Trying to understand the ideas we live by in isolation from the circumstances in which they are felicitously deployed is like studying a shoal of beached fish as if they were in their natural habitat.",

      'Hubble telescope sees haunting galactic dance of 2 galaxies linked by the corpse of a cannibalized neighbor',
      'Samantha Mathewson',
      "Two galaxies are intertwined in a turbulent gravitational dance in a stunning new view from the Hubble Space Telescope.The pair includes the large spiral galaxy NGC 3227 and the elliptical galaxy NGC 3226. The galaxies, collectively known as Arp 94, reside relatively close to Earth, between 50 million and 60 million light-years away, near the constellation Leo.The new Hubble Space Telescope view shows faint tidal streams of gas and dust linking NGC 3227 and NGC 3226 in their gravitational dance. Observations of this duet were captured as part of a program to measure black holes at the center of bright cluster galaxies, according to a statement from NASA(opens in new tab).NGC 3227 is classified as a Seyfert galaxy, a type of galaxy that has an active nucleus and is powered by a supermassive black hole at its core. As the black hole pulls in material from its surroundings, it releases vast amounts of radiation, which fuels the galaxy's active nucleus.Hubble was used to measure the mass of the galaxy's black hole by observing the dynamics of the inflowing gas at its core. The space telescope captured both visible red and near-infrared wavelengths of light, represented by the red areas of the image, according to the NASA statement.NGC 3227 is captured in the lower left of the Hubble image, while NGC 3226 is located to the upper right of its companion. The new photo, which NASA released May 25, offers a detailed view of the dark dust lanes and bright star-forming regions of NGC 3227, along with the bright streamers of material connecting the two galaxies. Previous Hubble observations suggest these streamers are remnants of a third galaxy that was likely consumed by NGC 3226, which, in turn, would have scattered shreds of gas and dust across space, NASA reported in 2014(opens in new tab).Earlier observations also suggest that NGC 3226 has a very low rate of star formation, despite the large streams of gas and dust — debris from the cannibalized galaxy — flowing into its core.

      'Future moon astronauts using water ice may rely on ancient lunar volcanoes',
      ' Rahul Rao ',
      "Volcanoes erupting on the moon billions of years ago may have created a layer of ice under the lunar surface, a new study suggests.The lava these active volcanoes spewed turned into maria, the dark regions that cover the moon's lowlands. But those volcanoes also belched out water vapor. As it touched the frigid moon, the water vapor would have frozen solid, forming a layer of ice a few meters under the lunar surface, researchers reported in the new study.-We envision it as a frost on the moon that built up over time,- lead study author Andrew Wilcoski, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder, said in a statement.In the study, the researchers simulated the surface of the moon as it would have looked and behaved some 2 billion to 4 billion years ago, with periodic volcanic eruptions on a still-active world. They assumed that a volcano erupted, on average, every 22,000 years.Even billions of years ago, the moon had no atmosphere. But those volcanic eruptions would have released considerable amounts of other gases, including water vapor. Those gases would have been enough to swirl around the entire moon and cover it with little temporary atmospheres.Those atmospheres wouldn't have been particularly long-lived, however; they would have dissipated into space after just a thousand years or so. But, the researchers found, even that short amount of time would have been enough for much of the water vapor to freeze into ice and settle back down, especially near the poles.The discovery has applications for future human lunar missions. Finding liquid water on the moon is increasingly important as astronauts and engineers start thinking about how to live on the moon sustainably, without having to ship vital supplies, like water, from Earth.Although previous research has confirmed the presence of water ice on the moon, scientists are still working to understand its location, geographic spread, how much lunar dust is mixed in, and other factors that will impact whether ice can be used as a resource.If the researchers' work, published May 3 in The Planetary Science Journal, is confirmed, it might point to key treasure lying under the poles.",

      'High altitudes may be a climate refuge for some birds, but not these hummingbirds',
      'Rachel Crowell',
      "Cooler, higher locales may not be very welcoming to some hummingbirds trying to escape rising temperatures and other effects of climate change.Anna’s hummingbirds live no higher than about 2,600 meters above sea level. If the birds attempt to expand their range to include higher altitudes, they may struggle to fly well in the thinner air, researchers report May 26 in the Journal of Experimental Biology.These hummingbirds have expanded their range in the past. Once only found in Southern California, the birds now live as far north as Vancouver, says Austin Spence, an ecologist at the University of California, Davis. That expansion is probably due to climate change and people using feeders to attract hummingbirds, he says.Spence and colleagues collected 26 Anna’s hummingbirds (Calypte anna) from different elevations in the birds’ natural range in California. The team transported the birds to an aviary about 1,200 meters above sea level and measured their metabolic rate when hovering. After relocating the hummingbirds to a field station at 3,800 meters altitude, the researchers let the birds rest for at least 12 hours and then measured that rate again.The rate was 37 percent lower, on average, at the higher elevation than the aviary, even though the birds should have been working harder to stay aloft in the thinner air (SN: 2/8/18). At higher altitudes, hovering, which takes a lot of energy compared with other forms of flight, is more challenging and requires even more energy, Spence says. The decrease in metabolic rate shows that the birds’ hovering performance was suffering, he says. “Low oxygen and low air pressure may be holding them back as they try to move upslope.”Additional work is needed to see whether the birds might be able to better adjust if given weeks or months to acclimate to the conditions at gradually higher altitudes.",

      'Some redwood leaves make food while others drink water',
      'Sofia Quaglia',
      "Redwoods are some of the world’s oldest, tallest and most resilient trees. They’re aided by fire-resistant bark and pest-resistant leaves. Plant researchers have now discovered something else that may help these trees deal with Earth’s changing climate. They have two different types of leaves — and each focuses on doing a different job.One type converts carbon dioxide into sugar through photosynthesis. This makes the tree’s food. The other leaves specialize in absorbing water, to slake a tree’s thirst.Let’s learn about trees : -It’s completely mind-blowing that redwoods have two types of leaves,” says Alana Chin. She is a plant scientist at the University of California, Davis. Despite redwoods being such a well-studied tree, -We did not know this,- she says.Chin and her colleagues shared their discovery March 11 in the American Journal of Botany.Their new finding may help explain how these redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) have proven so good at surviving at sites that can range from very wet to quite dry. The discovery also suggests redwoods may be able to adapt as their climate changes.Telling the two types of leaves apart Chin and her team stumbled upon the leafy surprise while examining bunches of leaves and shoots they had collected from six different redwood trees in different parts of California. They were looking to learn more about how these trees absorb water. Some were in a wet area, others in a dry region. Some leaves came from the bottom of a tree, others from various heights up to the treetops — which could be as much as 102 meters (about 335 feet) above the ground. In total, the team looked at more than 6,000 leaves.Explainer: How photosynthesis works Back in the lab, the researchers misted freshly cut leaves with fog. By weighing them before and after fogging, they could see how much moisture the greenery absorbed. They also measured how much each leaf could photosynthesize. The researchers even cut up the leaves and looked at them under a microscope.They expected all the leaves to look and respond more or less the same way. But they didn’t.Some leaves absorbed a lot of water. They were more curled. They seemed to wrap around the stem, almost as if they were hugging it. The outside of these leaves lacked a waxy, water-repellent coating. And their insides were full of water-storing tissue.What’s more, some of the important photosynthetic structures in these leaves appeared to be messed up. For example, the tubes by which leaves send newly made sugar into the rest of the plant were plugged up and smashed-looking. Chin’s team decided to call these leaves “axial” ones because they are closer to the woody stem — or axis — of the branch.The other type of leaves had more surface holes, known as stomata. These pores allow leaves to breathe in carbon dioxide (CO2) during photosynthesis and to exhale oxygen. Chin’s team now refers to these as peripheral (Pur-IF-er-ul) leaves, because they stick out from the edges of the branch. They unfurl out from the stem to catch more light. These leaves contained efficient sugar-moving tubes and had a thick, waxy “raincoat” over their surface. All of that suggests these leaves should be able to carry out photosynthesis even in wet climates.Most plants use one leaf type to both photosynthesize and absorb water. So it’s a surprise, Chin says, that these trees have a distinct leaf type that seems designed for drinking. A redwood still hosts many more food-making leaves than drinking leaves. By the numbers, more than 90 percent of a redwood’s leaves are the sugar-making type.Finding some super-slurper leaves in redwood trees “inspires us to look at leaves differently,” says Emily Burns. She’s a biologist at Sky Island Alliance. That’s a biodiversity group based in Tucson, Ariz. Burns did not take part in the new study, but she studies coastal redwoods and how they are impacted by fog. The new data, she says, reinforce that leaves can be “so much more than just photosynthesis machines.”The study also shows one reason why some plants have two different types of leaves or flowers. That pattern is called dimorphism. For the redwoods, it seems to help them adapt to varied climates. “This study reveals an underappreciated feature of shoot dimorphism,” Burns says.",

    'Seeing how odor is processed in the brain',
    'University of Tokyo',
    "Does the smell of a warm cup of coffee help you start your day the right way? Or can you not stand the strong, heady stuff? According to new research, how quickly your brain processes the smell of your morning beverage might depend on whether you think that odor is pleasant or not.A team at the University of Tokyo created a special device that can deliver 10 diverse odors in a way that is accurate and timely. The odors were administered to participants who rated their pleasantness while wearing noninvasive scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) caps, which record signals inside the brain. The team was then able to process the EEG data using machine learning-based computer analysis, to see when and where the range of odors was processed in the brain with high temporal resolution for the first time.We were surprised that we could detect signals from presented odors from very early EEG responses, as quickly as 100 milliseconds after odor onset, suggesting that representation of odor information in the brain occurs rapidly,_ said doctoral student Mugihiko Kato from the Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences at the University of Tokyo.Detection of odor by the brain occurred before the odor was consciously perceived by the participant, which didn't happen until several hundred milliseconds later. -Our study showed that different aspects of perception, in particular odor pleasantness, unpleasantness and quality, emerged through different spatial and temporal cortical processing,- said Kato.-The representation of unpleasantness in the brain emerged earlier than pleasantness and perceived quality,- said Project Associate Professor Masako Okamoto, also from the Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences .When unpleasant odors (such as rotten and rancid smells) were administered, participants' brains could differentiate them from neutral or pleasant odors as early as 300 milliseconds after onset. However, representation of pleasant odors (such as floral and fruity smells) in the brain didn't occur until 500 milliseconds onwards, around the same time as when the quality of the odor was also represented. From 600-850 milliseconds after odor onset, significant areas of the brain involved in emotional, semantic (language) and memory processing then became most involved.The earlier perception of unpleasant odors may be an early warning system against potential dangers. -The way each sensory system recruits the central nervous system differs across the sensory modalities (smell, light, sound, taste, pressure and temperature). Elucidating when and where in the brain olfactory (smell) perception emerges helps us to understand how the olfactory system works,-said Okamoto. -We also feel that our study has broader methodological implications. For example, it was not known that scalp-recorded EEG would allow us to assess representation of odors from time periods as early as 100 milliseconds.-This high temporal resolution imaging of how our brains process odors may be a stepping stone towards better understanding the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases in future, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, in which a dysfunction in the sense of smell is an early warning sign. The team is interested in exploring several further research avenues. -In our daily life, odors are perceived along with other sensory information like vision, and each sense influences the perception of the other,- said Kato. -Although we presented olfactory stimuli alone in the current study, we think that analyzing brain activity under more natural conditions, such as presenting odors with a movie, is important. Perhaps Smell-O-Vision might yet make a comeback?",

      'Superconducting neurons could match the power efficiency of the brain',
      'Emerging Technology from the arXiv',
      "The human brain is by far the most impressive computing device known to science. The brain operates at a clock speed of just a few hertz, snail-like in comparison to modern microprocessors that run at gigahertz speeds.But it gets its power by carrying out many calculations at the same time—a billion billion calculations per second. This parallelism allows it to solve problems with ease that conventional computers have yet to tackle: driving, walking, conversing, and so on.More impressive still is that it does all this powered by little more than a bowl of porridge. By contrast, the world’s most powerful supercomputers use more power than large towns.That’s why computer scientists want to copy the computing performance of the human brain using neural networks as computational workhorses.That’s easier said than done. Ordinary chips can be programmed to behave like neural networks, but this is computationally demanding and energy draining.Instead, computer scientists want to build artificial neurons and connect them together in brain-like networks. That has the potential to be significantly more energy efficient, but nobody has come up with a design that comes close to the efficiency of the brain.Until today. Enter Emily Toomey at MIT and a couple of colleagues, who have designed a superconducting neuron made from nanowires that in many ways behaves like a real one. They say their device matches the energy efficiency of the brain (at least in theory) and is the building block of a new generation of superconducting neural networks that will be vastly more efficient than conventional computing machinery.",
